# CP1295 ‚Äî Mini-Project (20%): "QuickNotes" ‚Äì Browser‚ÄëBased Sticky‚ÄëNote Board

**Individual Project ‚Äì Due August 10, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. (D2L submission)**

## 1. Purpose

QuickNotes is a compact single‚Äëpage web app that lets users create, move, edit, and delete virtual sticky notes directly in the browser. The workload is sized for 20% of the course grade while exercising every major topic in CP1295:

- DOM manipulation & events
- Custom objects & classes
- Browser storage & DevTools
- Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, async/await)
- ES‚Äëmodule organisation
- JSON parsing & generation
- Core Git / GitHub practices

## 2. Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Build and manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript events.
- Encapsulate state in a custom class (Note).
- Persist client‚Äëside data with localStorage and inspect it in DevTools.
- Write and consume asynchronous code that fetches external data.
- Structure a small codebase with ES modules (import/export).
- Serialize and deserialize data to/from JSON.
- Apply disciplined version control in a public GitHub repository.

## 3. Mandatory Features (Minimum Viable Product)

| # | Feature | Specification |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Add note | Typing text (or double‚Äëclicking the board) creates a coloured note `<div>` at the cursor. |
| 2 | Edit note | Click note ‚ûú inline textarea or modal; blur / Esc saves. |
| 3 | Drag & drop | Click‚Äëdrag moves a note; position persists. |
| 4 | Delete note | "üóëÔ∏è" button removes it with a fade‚Äëout. |
| 5 | Persistence | Notes (text, colour, x, y) auto‚Äësave to localStorage; restored on refresh. |
| 6 | Random‚Äëquote enhancer | "üí°" icon on a note fetches a productivity quote from an open API (async/await, error‚Äëhandled). |
| 7 | ES‚Äëmodule layout | Minimum files: main.js, ui.js, notes.js, storage.js. |
| 8 | JSON export | "Export" button downloads my‚Äënotes.json containing all notes. |

## 4. GitHub Workflow Requirement

- Create a public repository before writing any code.
- Initialise with a meaningful README that states the project goal.
- Use at least one feature branch (e.g., feature/drag) and merge through Pull Requests.
- Record ‚â• 8 meaningful commits (no single "final" dump).
- Comment on each PR and tag the final commit v1.0.0 before submission.
- A weak commit history will cap your GitHub workflow credit.

## 5. D2L Submission Requirements

- Working GitHub link ‚Äî the tagged release URL (https://github.com/‚Ä¶/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
- Demo video (‚â§ 3 min) ‚Äî screen recording with your own narration that shows:
  - User workflow (add, edit, drag, delete, export, quote fetch)
  - Overall code structure (modules, class, storage).
- No additional written report is required.

## 6. Marking Rubric (20%)

| Category | Criteria | Marks |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Functionality | All eight MVP features operate as specified | 10 |
| Code quality | Clear naming, modular structure, comments | 4 |
| Demo video | At least five minutes; audible narration; shows UI flow and key code; clear resolution | 6 |

## 7. Recommended Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Repo + README; basic HTML/CSS layout; add‚Äënote feature; start drag-and-drop |
| 2 | Complete drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop & delete; implement Note class; localStorage save/load |
| 3 | Refactor to ES modules; quote fetch with async/await; error handling |
| 4 | JSON export; UI polish; record demo video; tag release; submit on D2L |

## 8. Technical Constraints & Advice

- Plain HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks).
- Target evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Keep styles light; dark mode optional.
- Follow the Murach JavaScript style guide.
- Cite any significant external code inspirations in the README.

## 9. Academic Integrity

Discuss ideas freely, but write your own code. Uncredited copying will trigger disciplinary procedures at the college level.
